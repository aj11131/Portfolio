  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Austin Scott. I am a self-taught programmer that is currently working as a mechanical engineer. I graduated from Kansas State University in 2017 with a degree in mechanical engineering. During college I had a couple programming classes that dealt with C++ and robotics, but my interest in programming really took off after I graduated. I was interested in programming as a hobby so I began to teach myself. I started by taking the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science offered by Harvard online. This gave me a great knowledge foundation on which to start building. During CS50, I was especially interested in the web development portion. By the end of the course I was hooked. I started to delve deeper into the web development path. First becoming proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I then moved on to Angular, RxJS, and Node.js. I continue to improve my skills with these technologies daily and am searching for an opportunity to apply my skills professionally.

  Outside of work and programming, I enjoy archery, working on my motorcycle, and sports, particularly football. I love watching K-State and the Chiefs. Check out my <a routerLink="/projects">projects</a> page to see some of my work.
