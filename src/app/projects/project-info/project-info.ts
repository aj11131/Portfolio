Connecting location and weather API and getting them to work together was a great learning experience. The biggest challenge I faced in this project was getting the weather information on the page to update after selecting a different location without reloading the page. I found behavior subjects in RxJS as an invaluable tool for this. They allowed me to easily notify the other components in the app of the change in location.',

    learned: 'In this project, I learned how useful Angular is for creating reusable components. Instead of creating a button element for each button on the calculator, I was able to generate the buttons from an array of button objects using the NgFor directive. The biggest obstacle of this project was dealing with nested operations such as sin(cos(tan(45))). To solve this problem, I used a recursive function that solves the nested operations from inside out.',
