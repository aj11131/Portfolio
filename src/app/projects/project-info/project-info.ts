Once the user is located, the coordinates are sent to Google's Places API and Dark Sky's weather API. To change the displayed location, the search bar can be used. Input from this searchbar will send a request to Google's Places API and return a list of the 5 top matches of the current input. If one of these matches is selected, the data associated with that result is emitted using an RxJs Subject that the weather display is subscribed to. These components will update displaying the new data.`,

The formatted string is then evaluated. If there are nested calculator functions such as sin(cos()), the formatting function is called recursively and the inner function is evaluated and then the outer function. How the trigonometric functions are calculated can be toggled between degrees and radians using the switch located near the main display.`,
